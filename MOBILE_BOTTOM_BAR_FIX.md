## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **Fix 1: Increased z-index** 🔧
**Issue**: Bottom bar was being covered by other elements  
**Solution**: Changed `z-50` to `z-[9999]`

```tsx
// Before
className="... z-50 ..."

// After
className="... z-[9999] ..."
```

**Result**: Bottom bar now always on top ✅

---

### **Fix 2: Fixed Layout Constraints** 📐
**Issue**: `max-w-lg` and `justify-around` causing alignment problems  
**Solution**: Changed to `max-w-full` and `justify-between` with proper gaps

```tsx
// Before
<div className="flex items-center justify-around px-4 py-3 max-w-lg mx-auto">

// After
<div className="flex items-center justify-between gap-2 px-3 py-3 max-w-full">
```

**Changes**:
- `justify-around` → `justify-between` (better spacing)
- `max-w-lg` → `max-w-full` (no width constraint)
- `px-4` → `px-3` (tighter padding)
- Added `gap-2` (consistent spacing)

**Result**: Buttons properly aligned across full width ✅

---

### **Fix 3: Optimized Button Sizing** 🎯
**Issue**: Buttons too large (60px) causing overflow  
**Solution**: Reduced to 56px with proper flex properties

```tsx
// Icon Buttons (Call & WhatsApp)
// Before: h-[60px] w-[60px]
// After:  h-[56px] w-[56px] flex-shrink-0

// Booking Button
// Before: h-[60px] px-6
// After:  h-[56px] px-4 flex-1
```

**Changes**:
- Reduced height from 60px to 56px
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to icon buttons (prevent shrinking)
- Added `flex-1` to booking button (fills available space)
- Reduced padding from `px-6` to `px-4`
- Added `truncate` to button text (prevents overflow)
- Reduced icon sizes from `h-6 w-6` to `h-5 w-5` and `h-4 w-4`

**Result**: All buttons fit perfectly on screen ✅
